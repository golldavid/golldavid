### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- I've just finished my master thesis in Physics at the Humboldt University of Berlin:
  "Analysis of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning from a Statistical Physics Perspective"
- The results were partly published in https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00160
- The code for the paper can be found in the repo PaperCompanion_DetModelMAQL
